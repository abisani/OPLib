// EFloatingPointUnit.cs --- Part of the project OPLib 1.0, a high performance pricing library
// based on operator methods, higher level BLAS and multicore architectures 

// Author:     2009 Claudio Albanese
// Maintainer: Claudio Albanese <claudio@albanese.co.uk>
// Created:    April-July 2009
// Version:    1.0.0
// Credits:    The CUDA code for SGEMM4, SGEMV4 and SSQMM were inspired by 
//             Vasily Volkov's implementation of SGEMM
//			   We use several variations of the multi-threaded Mersenne Twister algorithm of 
//			   period 2203 due to Makoto Matsumoto.
//             The Monte Carlo routine in SMC includes code by Victor Podlozhnyuk 
//             included in the CUDA SDK.
//             CPU-side BLAS and random number generators link to primitives in the
//			   Intel Math Kernel Libraries.
